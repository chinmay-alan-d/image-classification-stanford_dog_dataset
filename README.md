# image-classification-stanford_dog_dataset

i used a specific library called opendatasets. because, i was running my code in google collab. I was importing dataset from collab. to import data from 
kaggle to collab, it will ask kaggle username and kaggle key. 
This process is explained in the following link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-import-kaggle-datasets-directly-into-google-colab/

1. Dataset 
  Stanford dog dataset contains more than 20k images of 120 breeds of dogs. 
  
2. Method:
  * vanila CNN:
    The code includes implementation of vanila CNN. which has less accuracy about 12%, even after data augmentation techniques.
  * Transer learning:
    Inception V3 is used as a pretrained model to classify images. By this method i achived 77% accuracy.
